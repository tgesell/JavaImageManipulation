1)  Add additional filters that extend the Filter class.  Complete at least:
VerticalFlipFilter
GreyScaleFilter
GaussianBlurFilter
NegativeImageFilter (you will need to set this one up with a new class, and configure it in SnapShopConfiguration class)

2) Optional (a couple of extra credit points for each - max 10)  Try any or all of these:
NegativeImage
Lighten10
One or more of the other 3x3 filters (Laplacian, Unsharp, Emboss, Edgy)
There were some filters in the similar CSAwesome exercise (remove blue, all blue, etc.)  You could implement some of those.
You can make up your own filter or filters too
*) Don't forget to modify the SnapShopConfiguration class, so that SnapShop knows about the Filters that you added.

Submit:  Please submit a zip file of all of the .java files that are part of this project.  Especially don't forget to include VeritcalFlipFilter.java, GreyScaleFilter.java, NegartiveImageFilter.java, GaussianBlurFilter.java and all of the specific .java files for all of the filters that you created.
